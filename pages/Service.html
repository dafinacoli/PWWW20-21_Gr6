You can choose from a variety of styles, lengths and curls to create a look you’ll love.
                <br> <br>
                Your stylist will help you select a style best suited for your eye and face shape, your desired look, and even your lifestyle.  You’ll start with one of our four amazing styles, and customize as you wish to achieve the lashes of your dreams.</p>

                <h1>Permanent Make-up</h1>

                <p>Cosmetic tattooing is the implantation of a pigment, derived from organic and/or inorganic compounds, into the dermis layer of the skin, thereby ensuring the long-lasting effect of the procedure. 
                   Permanent make-up allows a person to wake up in the morning with most of their make-up applied. 
                   There are thousands of people wearing permanent make-up that you would never suspect because properly applied, it should look totally natural as though you just don’t need to wear make-up.
                 <br><br>
                 A trained and qualified micro-pigmentation technician will consult and review your procedure with you and will advise your best choice of colours and shape.
