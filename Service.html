            <h1>Eye lash extensions</h1>

            <p>Lash extensions are synthetic fibers individually attached to each of your natural lashes. They give you the longer, thicker lashes you wish you were born with and they look and feel completely natural. You can choose from a variety of styles, lengths and curls to create a look you’ll love.
                <br> <br>
                Your stylist will help you select a style best suited for your eye and face shape, your desired look, and even your lifestyle.  You’ll start with one of our four amazing styles, and customize as you wish to achieve the lashes of your dreams.</p>
